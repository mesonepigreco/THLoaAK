# THLoaAK
That Hard Life of an Ancient Kingdom.

This is the skedule of a RPG game. The most important focus of the game is the strong character identification.
The philosophy of the game is that the player is the soul of the character it is playing. Therefore, to be able to cast strong spells or perform strong martial arts the player itself must be strong.
The difficulty in making actions is translated in difficulty for the player. For this reason, even a low level character played by a very skilled player can perform high level spells, while a high-level character played by a not so good player will not be able to perform even easy spells.
In this way, the character development must concurr with a player development in the abilities. So rather than levelling up, as standard RPG games, the player itself must acquire new skill while playing.
