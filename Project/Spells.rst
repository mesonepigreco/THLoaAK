Spells
======

Spells can be casted by almost every class.
However, the process of casting spell is very different among classes.

Seals of magic
--------------

Wizards employ seals of magic to cast spells. Thanks to seals of magic it is possible to cast the 
most powerfull spells, however they also require a very long preparation.

A spell is composed by a formula that must be chanted at the beginning of the process, and then a peculiar sequence of
magic seals that must be released.


What is a seal of magic?
------------------------

Seals of magic are portals that release elemental mana when activated. Eeach seal release a mana in a different way. They must be infused with a particular element, including *light* or *darkness*.
The seal is composed by a *medallion*, a circle that encompasses the *diagram*.
*Diagrams* are peculiar geometrical figures, that determines the way mana power is released by the seal, on the opposite, the *medallion* may include additional effects or exclude some. The more refined the seal drawing is, the more powerfull the spell will be.

For example, the simple spell *continual light*, that provides a blowing spot in front of the caster, is made by just one seal of magic, infused with *light* element.

[DRAWING OF CONTINUAL LIGHT SEAL]

However, we can power up the spell by drawing a more refined seal. In this way we will increase both the duration of the spell than the amount of light produced.

Indeed, higher-tier spells will need more than one seal to be released in the correct succession.



Scrolls
-------


The seals of magic may be prepared in advance, through scrolls, to speed up the cast time of the spell.
Using scrolls is much faster than preparing the seal live, however, after their use, the seal disappear from the scroll, and it becomes useless. Also, the effect of a spell casted through scrolls do not benefit of eventual positive conditions on the caster.

Scroll may be prepared on enchanted parchments. The wizard can either buy bare parchments to enchant and prepare the seal by himself, or buy already done seals, with the price varying on the quality of the enchantment of the parchment and on the refinements of the seals.
Indeed, wizard may also sell scrolls they prepared, as they are often quite valuable. 

When using a scroll to cast a magic, a wizard consume the correspective amout of mana power. 
A caster cannot use a seal tha release a kind of mana that he did not mastered, e.g. a wizard that controls only *lightning* and *fire* cannot use a scroll releasing a seal of *wind*.



Live release
------------

Instead of using scrolls, a wizard may also cast a spell by releasing the seals live, without preparation.
In this way the time required to cast a spell is considerably improved. The wizard must either use a spell tome, or remember the sequence of seals by heart when casting a spell. However, spells casted in this way will benefits on power ups (that can be given by the weapon, if the wizard is using a staff, or positive conditions on the caster). Moreover, releasing live the seal, the wizard will consume only half of the mana required by a scroll.
This allow a wizard to use more spell in a fight, or to cast higher-tier magic than it would be impossible to him with scrolls.



Traps
-----

Seals of magic can be inscribed also on the ground. In this case different seals to activate the magic should be combined together in a single seal. The spell is casted when someone steps on the seal. 
In this way, wizards can prepare traps or spells that protect area. A seal of magic can also as big to completely inscribe an ambient, in this case, the trap is activated whenever someone steps on the ground of the ambient. Activation of seals may be controlled
by magic, for example, if some seal is added to the sequence of seals, the magic may require a password to avoid activation, or
the activation can be delayed in time.


Vocalising
----------

Vocalizations are peculiar spells casted by bards.
These spells alter conditions. They vary from inflicting negative or positive conditions to people, to even affect weather.
They are casted without seals, by the successful vocal intonation of the spell.
The sound emitted by bards when they cast this kind of magic resemble the a Tibetan mantra.


Ninjutzu
========

This kind of magic is exclusive of the ranger class, and a speciality of the ninja.
Ninjutzu is based on chakra, rather than mana like wizards.
While mana represent itself for its elemental nature, chakra are center of energy inside the body of the caster.
Instead of using scrolls to activate spells, ninjutzu uses particular sequences of body positions that affect the flux of energy through their body by activating or inhibiting the chakras. 

Thanks to the physic nature of the chackra, casting ninjutzu is much faster than releasing seals of magics. 
Since ninjutzu is related to flux of energy inside the body of the caster, the effect of the spells are limited to the immediate proximity of the caster, and mostly limited to modification to the attributes of the caster's body and mental state.
However, they can also be used to hypnotize people, affecting them with negative conditions or putting them to sleep.
Most powerfull ninjutzu can also enslave the will of the target, forcing it to obey the caster for a limited time.


How to cast a ninjutzu
----------------------

Ninjutzu can be casted through a sequence of *yoga* positions releasing or blocking the energy flow from the chakra of the caster.
The caster needs to know how to execute all the *yoga* positions required by a spell to release it.

Differently from seals of magic spells, that require the caster to chant aloud the name of the spell, ninjutzu can be casted without
noise, that makes it perfect for stealth operation. 
For correctly managing chakra energy, the caster must open the sequence of *yoga* positions with an opening position, that will activate the energy flux. The sequence must also be closed with a particular *yoga* position, that is called *release*. 
This last position will start the ninjutzu. 

However, ninjutzu is dangerous. If the sequence of *yoga* position is wrong, the caster can be injured by the uncontrolled flux of energy flowing in its chakra. For this purpouse, another closing sequence, *revert*, can be used to restore the normal chakra flux without releasing it. In this case, no ninjutzu will be performed. 




Prays
=====

Prists can cast spells through prays. 
Their effect is mostly of healing and increasing abilities of allies. Prays of monks are of self-effect, they can expand monks abilities far beyond uman abilities, they include automatic self-healing, increase of strenght, physical resistance and mental resistance.

There are few preys that can deal damage to enemies, and these are the *exorcisms*. However, *exorcisms* have effect only against deamons or angels.
