Classes
=======

The class of a character identifies its profession and skills.
Unlike most RPG games, classes in THLoaAK are not static, but they are simple identification of the character behaviour and the most practiced skills.

There are five main classes:

1. **Wizard**.
2. **Ranger**
3. **Warrior**
4. **Prist**

Wizard
------

The wizard strangth is to cast spells. Spells can be used to everyday usage, has to shed light, to enhance armors or abilities, to move objects. They can be also used for battleling, dealing damage, inflicting negative conditions or to summon a servant.

The wizard class divides in many specialization.

1. **Sorcerers**
   They specialized in ranged magical spells and are mostly warrior wizards.
   Their magic focuses in inflicting damage or conditions to enemy. They can also enhance armors, or detect magic.
2. **Illusionits**
   They are masters of illusions. They can make themselves or other invisible, or can project fake image in other position. Therefore are very good in stealth missions.
3. **Negromants**
   They are specialized with dead magic. They can summon undead or bind a living soul to a corpose, enslaving it to respond to their commands. Due to the intrisically evil result of their magics, negromantic magic is illegal. Negromants must practice their magic secretely, and prefers practicing during night.
4. **Elementalists**
   They are specialized in controlling the five elements of nature. They are *fire*, *wind*, *lightning*, *water* and *earth*. Good elementalists often can perfectly control two elements, but nothing in principle prevents them to control more. Their magic can be used both to attack, defend and also for everyday usage. 

Magic is usually taught into the Wizard Guild. However, women cannot access to the guild due to a restriction put on by the Arcimage, toghether with races considered not suited for study magic (*orcs* and *half-humans*). Indeed, also negromatic arts are not taught in the Guild.
Those who are excluded from the Wizard Guild and wants to learn magic must do by themselves, by accessing to libraries (secretely if not allowed).

Indeed, there is also the underworld organization of negromants, they will accept anyone without distiction of race and sex, if you are willing to join a criminal association.

Ranger
------

Rangers are a wide class of profession that combact from the distance. They can use simple spells, and have the physical ability to sustain a short distance combact. Rangers are usually expert in sthealt operation.
They also divided in subclasses:

1. **Thiefs**
   They are expert in stealth moves, with their skills they can open locks and move silently. They are also expert in assassination operation, managing poisons and making smart instruments for combact (hidden blades, poisoned darts).
2. **Scout**
   A scout is expert in taming animals. He is often followed by a tamed wolf, that will respond to its command. It will combact mainly with a bow and arrows, with assistance from its companions.
3. **Ninja**
   This class is very similar to Thiefs, but instead of technology, they use a particular kind of magic called ninjutzu. Ninjustu is very difficult to learn, however, when applied in combat it is very effective and dangerous. Some lords of the kingdom forbidden Ninjutzu in their lands, however, almost all of them will hire a ninja for assassination operation.

Unlike wizards, warriors and prits, there is not a specific guild for rangers. However, most of them are associated to the Guild of Adventurers, as many works from the guild require stealth operations. Often you will find rangers mentors that will take with them apprendists for adventuring missions. This is probably the most efficient way to improve the skill as a ranger.

Warrior
-------

Warriors prefer the phisical combact. They wears heavy armors. Unlike all the other classes, there are no specific warrior subclasses, however their fightstyle can be very unique.
They can specialize with different type of armors and weapons, spears, maces, two-hand swords, one hand sword and shield.
They can also cast simple self-powering spells, that if combined with smashing their weapons creates *martial arts*.

Warriors are trained in the Guild of War. They may become guards, sheriffs, soldiers or knights.  They can be payed for patrolling missions, or in military expenditions. 

They can acquire the ability to ride war horses, and can partecipate to turnaments.

    This allow monk to fight at the same level against full armored enemies even with just sack clothing.
    Monks prefer and short range combat.
2. **Clercs**
    They are armored warriors. They can use their affinity with the divinity to cast spells. Theirs spells focus on healing targets, or
