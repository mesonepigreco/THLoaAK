2. **Ranger**
3. **Warrior**
4. **Prist**

3. **Negromants**
   They are specialized with dead magic. They can summon undead or bind a living soul to a corpose, enslaving it to respond to their commands.

4. **Elementalists**
   They are specialized in controlling the five elements of nature. They are *fire*, *wind*, *lightning*, *water* and *earth*. Good elementalists often can perfectly control two elements, but nothing in principle prevents them to control more. Their magic can be used both to attack, defend and also for everyday usage. 

Magic is usually taught into the Wizard Guild. However, women cannot access to the guild due to a restriction put on by the Arcimage, toghether with races considered not suited for study magic (*orcs* and *half-humans*). Indeed, also negromatic arts are not taught in the Guild.
Those who are excluded from the Wizard Guild and wants to learn magic must do by themselves, by accessing to libraries (secretely if not allowed).
